Creating a Python AI app to transcribe a YouTube video involves several key steps. The app will need to:

Download the audio from the YouTube video.
Transcribe the audio into text using a speech-to-text service.
Here's how you can do it:
1. Install Required Libraries
You'll need a few Python libraries:

pytube to download the YouTube video.
pydub to handle audio processing.
speech_recognition for transcribing the audio.
Install these using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pytube pydub speechrecognition
If you don't have ffmpeg (required by pydub), you need to install it:

On Windows, download and add ffmpeg to your PATH.
On Linux, you can install it using sudo apt-get install ffmpeg.
On macOS, use brew install ffmpeg.
2. Download and Extract Audio from YouTube Video
Hereâ€™s a Python script to download the audio from a YouTube video:

python
Copy code
from pytube import YouTube
from pydub import AudioSegment

def download_audio(youtube_url):
    yt = YouTube(youtube_url)
    audio_stream = yt.streams.filter(only_audio=True).first()
    audio_file = audio_stream.download(filename='audio.mp4')

    # Convert mp4 audio to wav format for speech recognition
    audio = AudioSegment.from_file(audio_file, format="mp4")
    audio.export("audio.wav", format="wav")

    return "audio.wav"
3. Transcribe the Audio
Now, use the speech_recognition library to transcribe the audio:

python
Copy code
import speech_recognition as sr

def transcribe_audio(audio_file):
    recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
    with sr.AudioFile(audio_file) as source:
        audio = recognizer.record(source)

    # Transcribe the audio using Google's free service
    try:
        text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
        print("Transcription: ", text)
    except sr.UnknownValueError:
        print("Google Speech Recognition could not understand the audio")
    except sr.RequestError as e:
        print(f"Could not request results from Google Speech Recognition service; {e}")
    
    return text
4. Putting It All Together
Here's the full code to download and transcribe a YouTube video:

python
Copy code
from pytube import YouTube
from pydub import AudioSegment
import speech_recognition as sr

def download_audio(youtube_url):
    yt = YouTube(youtube_url)
    audio_stream = yt.streams.filter(only_audio=True).first()
    audio_file = audio_stream.download(filename='audio.mp4')

    # Convert mp4 audio to wav format for speech recognition
    audio = AudioSegment.from_file(audio_file, format="mp4")
    audio.export("audio.wav", format="wav")

    return "audio.wav"

def transcribe_audio(audio_file):
    recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
    with sr.AudioFile(audio_file) as source:
        audio = recognizer.record(source)

    # Transcribe the audio using Google's free service
    try:
        text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
        print("Transcription: ", text)
    except sr.UnknownValueError:
        print("Google Speech Recognition could not understand the audio")
    except sr.RequestError as e:
        print(f"Could not request results from Google Speech Recognition service; {e}")
    
    return text

if __name__ == "__main__":
    youtube_url = input("Enter the YouTube video URL: ")
    audio_file = download_audio(youtube_url)
    transcription = transcribe_audio(audio_file)
    print("Final Transcription:", transcription)
Key Points:
Audio Quality: The quality of the transcription depends on the clarity of the audio. Background noise and accents may affect accuracy.
Limitations: The recognize_google function has a limit on the length of the audio it can handle, and Googleâ€™s API might have usage limits.
Advanced Options: For more robust transcription, consider using services like Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, which can handle longer audio files and offers better accuracy.
This script will download the audio from a YouTube video, convert it to WAV format, and then transcribe it to text. Enjoy your new transcribing app! ðŸŽ§ðŸ’»ðŸ“¹
